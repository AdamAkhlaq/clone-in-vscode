# Privacy Policy for GitHub Clone in VS Code

Last updated: **July 22, 2025**

## Overview

GitHub Clone in VS Code ("the Extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains how our extension handles information.

## Information We Collect

**We collect NO personal information.**

The Extension:

- ✅ Does NOT collect any personal data
- ✅ Does NOT track user behavior
- ✅ Does NOT store any information locally or remotely
- ✅ Does NOT transmit any data to external servers
- ✅ Does NOT use analytics or tracking services

## Permissions Used

The Extension requests minimal permissions:

### Host Permission: `*://github.com/*`

- **Purpose**: Required to inject the "Clone in VS Code" button on GitHub pages
- **Scope**: Only active on GitHub.com domains
- **Data Access**: None - we only modify the visual interface

## How It Works

1. When you visit a GitHub repository page, the Extension:

   - Detects you're on a GitHub repository page
   - Adds a "Clone in VS Code" button to the existing Code dropdown
   - Generates a `vscode://` URL when clicked

2. The Extension does NOT:
   - Read repository content
   - Access your GitHub account
   - Store any information about repositories you visit
   - Communicate with any external services

## Data Security

Since we don't collect any data, there's no data to secure or breach. The Extension operates entirely locally in your browser.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.
